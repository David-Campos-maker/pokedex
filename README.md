# MyPokédex
This Project was a challenge proposed to improve development with Vue.js and Typescript. MyPokédex aims to provide useful information for players who have a competitive interest in Pokémon, or for those who want to know more about their favorite little monsters.

This website provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokémon. We specifically cover the video game franchise. Using this website, you can consume information on Pokémon, their moves, abilities, types, egg groups and much, much more.
